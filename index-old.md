## About Qboi
Hello, I'm Qboi and I code since 2014.  

Now I can code in multiple languages; C++, Kotlin, Java, Visual Basic, C#, Python, BASIC.  
Most of the time I work on projects like Minecraft mods, utility software and sometimes a game called Bubble Blaster.  
Feel free to help with projects (as long it's allowed in the License which it is in [Ultreon Team](https://github.com/Ultreon), [MultiTeam](https://github.com/MultiTeamDevGroup) and from [my own profile](https://github.com/Qboi123)).  
Also, I've joined [MultiTeam](https://github.com/MultiTeamDevGroup) at April 14th 2021, and made originally Qplay Software, then QSoftware and then [Ultreon Team](https://github.com/Ultreon).
